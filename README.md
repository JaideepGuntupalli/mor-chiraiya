## My process

I have used Gatsby JS, a frontend framework built on React JS. My choice was due to it's ability to render static pages with React Code which increases the maintainability. I also has a wide range of plugins supporting various different workflows. Due to this, i was able to include brotli compression as part of the static page generation. This reduced the load significantly.

### Built with

-   Gatsby
-   ReactJS
-   JSX
-   Tailwind CSS
-   Brotli Compression
